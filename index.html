                <p>This documentation covers some of the aspects to consider when prototyping a website and then how to set up a process to make that design into production.</p>
                <p>This documentation covers thusly:</p>

                    <li><b>Introduction</b>: what you can expect of this documentation.</li>
                    <li><b>Prerequisites</b>: what we expect of the reader.</li>
                    <li><b>Prototyping</b>: before you drive, know where you are going!</li>
                    <li><b>Development</b>: now, drive where you planned to go!</li>

                </ul>

                <p>Congratulations!</p>
                <p>Just reading this introduction means that you have considered weather planning ahead is a good idea.
                Sure, it's fun to just jump in. But please, make sure there are no sharks beforehand!</p>
                <img src="images/No shark.png" alt="A pool with no shark in it.">

                <p>This time we will do without jumping in, even if it looks safe for now. So let's look ahead. 
                Prototyping in the context of producing a website means drafting a blueprint for design and 
                user experience. It entails setting up goals, and objectives to achieve those goals. It can 
                cover what technologies are needed.</p>

                <p>The objectives guide the development. The clearer and simpler the objectives, the easier it is 
                to make increments to achieve the goals. Sometimes it all comes down to implementing a design with 
                HTML and CSS.</p>

                <p>Let's get started.</p>

                <p>Reading this documentation means that you are proficient in english. That's great. 
                That's the first prerequisite. Other prerequisites are listed below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Handy with a computer</li>
                    <li>Know the difference between a bug and a feature</li>
                    <li>Knowledgeable in HTML and CSS.</li>
                    <li>Knowledgeable about Adobe XD or similar software for UI/UX design</li>
                    <li>Knowledgeable about the difference between UI and UX.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The documentation is meant to guide you to set up your own processes for prototyping 
                and developing websites. This means that you should be willing to implement these 
                recommendations in a way that suits your business.</p>

                <p>So if you just thought that sharks is all you have to worry about, think again!
                Jumping in to the water without a plan might have been an okey idea. But did you consider the scale?
                Prototyping takes care of what might come as a surprise further down the road if you had not.</p>
                
                <p>A place to start with prototyping is to set up a goal and objectives. 
                A goal could be to have an aesthetically pleasing Personal Website. Objectives to achieve this could be 
                to pick colours and fonts fitting your theme, as well as designing elements and where to put them, 
                and write a presentation.</p>

                <p>Having an idea where you want to go, it's then time to make your design. During this process it's 
                possible you have to modify your objectives; you may view some objectives in a new light as you work 
                with them.</p>

                <p>A popular protoyping software is Adobe XD. It has features to cover designing both a 
                <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> as well as <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr>. Adobe XD makes 
                it easy to design your website for different screens, and so it makes a good foundation for a 
                Responsive Website.</p>

                <p>With a prototyping software it's easy to see where elements go, what sizes they should be and which 
                colours to use. Here's an example of how a prototype from Adobe XD can look like: </p>
                <img id="mockup" src="images/Home.png" alt="A prototype as an image of a website.">

                <p>Having a finished prototype, you are then ready to move over to development.</p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Development">
            <header>Development</header>
            <article>
                <p>You should now know what elements go into your website. If you haven't chosen what technologies to use, 
                now is a good time!</p>
                <p>Add the elements you need to your first page. At this point, focus on making it semantically consistent 
                and comprehensible. You want your site to meet accessibility demands. A first accessibility demand is to make 
                sure that font size and contrast makes for easy reading. If it does not, go back to the design stage and make 
                it so. But a more subtle accessibility demand is to place elements in a order that makes sense and using the 
                correct element. Let's reiterate, focus on making it semantically consistent first - choosing an h3 over an
                h2 because it looks better that way is not! </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;!-- what's missing? --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This is a subheading&lt;/h3&gt;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>After you have your elements in place, take another look over. Is there elements that needs further explanation 
                    for any one using screen readers? Are clickable items as clickable as they should be? Are they of right 
                    type of element (a button vs a link can mean different things).
                </p>
                <p>Next up, add some style! Having the prototype makes for a better end result - otherwise it is easy to get 
                    swept away by all the effects you can implement, or perhaps limit yourself because you can't imagine 
                    how to achieve something. With the prototype at hand you have your objectives. Focus on the big things first. 
                    How do you want to control placements? Margins and floats? Flex? Grid? Depending on the demands of your site, 
                    a place to start is to work from the top down. In that way you also work with bigger elements before moving 
                    down to the details.
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
body {
    padding: 1em 2em 1em 2em; 
}

main {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

section {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
}
                    </pre>
                </code>

                <p>Having nailed the coding part of the presentation it's time to focus on what happens with it on 
                    different screens. Responsiveness is key! So we're really not ready to move on from from presentation
                    until we have a site that works well on all supported screens.
                </p>
                <p>Once presentation has been taken care of it's time to focus on behaviour of the site. What is interactive 
                    or dynamic? Will you implement this behaviour with CSS or JS? Here's a snippet of how to implement a 
                    behaviour to indicated where on a page a visitor is by adding a css-class on the item of question: 
                </p>

                <p>A good idea is to fetch the elements that are involved in the behaviour to be affected.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>

let homeLink = document.getElementById("home-link");
let scienceLink = document.getElementById("science-link");
let aboutLink = document.getElementById("about-link");


let homeElement = document.getElementById("home");
let scienceElement = document.getElementById("science");
let aboutElement = document.getElementById("about");

let yHome = homeElement.getBoundingClientRect().y;
let yScience = scienceElement.getBoundingClientRect().y;
let yAbout = aboutElement.getBoundingClientRect().y;
                    </pre>
                </code>

                <p>Then address what action should activate the behaviour. In this case it's scrolling:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
window.onscroll = function changeClass() {
    yHome = homeElement.getBoundingClientRect().y;
    yScience = scienceElement.getBoundingClientRect().y;
    yAbout = aboutElement.getBoundingClientRect().y;

    let scrollPosY = window.pageYOffset 
        | document.body.scrollTop;
    if (scrollPosY < yScience) {
        homeLink.className = ('link-container active');
        scienceLink.className = ('link-container');
        aboutLink.className = ('link-container');
    } else if (scrollPosY < yAbout + 158) {
        homeLink.className = ('link-container');
        scienceLink.className = ('link-container active');
        aboutLink.className = ('link-container');
    } else if (scrollPosY > yAbout + 158){
        homeLink.className = ('link-container');
        scienceLink.className = ('link-container');
        aboutLink.className = ('link-container active');
    }
}
                    </pre>
                </code>
                <p>For debugging purposes, console.log() can be included in the changeClass-function.</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
console.log("Got these y-coordinates... home:" + yHome + 
" science:" + yScience + " about:" + yAbout);
console.log("\n Scroll pos:" + scrollPosY);
                    </pre>
                </code>

                <p>You have come a long way at this point, having made a prototype, then added the elements in a 
                    semantic relevant way, followed by styling and finalizing with adding behavior.

            <header>Lessons Learned</header>
            <article>
                <p>We have covered a lot of ground, very fast, in a logical way that would make the process appear as 
                    a one-way street. But of course, it is not! It's possible at any point to go back to the 
                    prototyping phase with the new knowledge gained. At times it can even be that you are working with 
                    behaviour and realize that the elements doesn't make semantic sense in how you want it to behave.  
                </p>
                <p>A lessons learned is therefore to leave room for contemplation at any stage. After having made a 
                    prototype, take some time off when you don't look at it. "Go smell the flowers." When you come back 
                    you should be prepared to see the prototype in a new way and adjust it if need be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another lessons learned which is affected by the lesson previously; be humble! It is not probable 
                    that the first draft you make, or the first implimentation of it that you do, is going to be the 
                    best you can do. It can always be made better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And a final lesson, which hinges on the first: Set a deadline. Since your project can always be made 
                    better, it can become an activity without an end. Having a goal and a set of objectives, be prepared 
                    to call it a day when those are met.
